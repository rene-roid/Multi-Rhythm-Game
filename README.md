<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This game is a combination of multiple types of rhythm games, for now there are only 2 in development, this game is inspired by the games, Everhood and Muse Dash. The game is still in development and will be updated frequently. 

The game is a follow up to my previous project, [Rythm Wooga](https://github.com/rene-roid/RythmWooga) that I made for a school project.
